# GeoemtricAssessment
each folder contains one of the three assessments. in that folder is the base code and a recording. I did not have time to complete the extra credits in my code base, and some of them were just explantaions, so i decided the best way to go about it was to record myself discussing the extra credit and my experience with each project.
